## Features
The list of our issues/features can be found on our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/1gaDEa3O/pace-board).
## Demo
You can check out the latest version of the app on heroku: [https://dev-pace.herokuapp.com/](https://dev-pace.herokuapp.com/)
## Dev Setup
Pace is currently based on [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org), therefore you will need both on your machine. It also uses **Vagrant** for the database. 
* To install Vagrant, go [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Or if you have **brew cask** on your machine, just do the following: `brew cask install vagrant`.
* To install node, go either to https://nodejs.org/ or if you are using a mac & brew use the following command: `brew install node`. 
* To get all the other dependencies and be able to start **pace** locally, just navigate to the pace folder and run: `npm install && gulp dev-setup`
* To initialize the database: `gulp create-db`

To look at the db in your terminal, just connect to the vagrant box (from the postgres directory) via `vagrant ssh` and type psql.

### If you really don't want to use vagrant
it is possible to use docker instead. Run this to get the database up:

`docker run -p 5432:5432 -d --name 'pace-postgres' -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD='some_password' -e POSTGRES_DB='pace' -e POSTGRES_USER='pace' postgres`

You have to set the DATABASE_URL to point to the non default db. Setting a environment variable is the easiest way:

`export DATABASE_URL='postgres://pace:some_password@localhost/pace'`

#### Starting
Just run `gulp` and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

#### Running tests
For **unit** tests: `gulp test`

For **integration** tests: `gulp test-integration`

For **functional** tests: `gulp test-functional` (install **selenium** if needed: `gulp selenium-install`)

#### Running jshint
Here you go: `gulp lint`

### Running in docker
Run pace inside docker:
```
docker-compose up 
```
Create the database needed:
```
docker-compose run pace-app /usr/src/app/node_modules/db-migrate/bin/db-migrate up
```

Pace will be reachable on http://localhost:3000
